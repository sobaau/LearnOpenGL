# LearnOpenGL
BEWARNED This project in no way fully adhears to best practices or anytype of coding standings or even proper design patterns. Although, *some* care has been taken to avoid memory leaks.
The main purpoes of this project is to experiment with learning OpenGL from the LearnOpenGL [website](https://learnopengl.com). 
Along with some [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and a few other things mixed in.

A MAJOR MAJOR refactor is needed. Even more so with the imports and header files.

CMake is used for the building the project and has only been tested on MacOS with Clang and briefly on Windows using MSVC.
